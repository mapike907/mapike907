# Hi, I'm Melissa Pike.

I'm an epidemiologist and data analyst, who currently works remotely with CDPHE in the Special Projects Team. With over fifteen years working in data quality, I enjoy working on a wide array of different and challenging projects. 
Why do I like working in science and data? 
I love collaborating with others to solve problems.
